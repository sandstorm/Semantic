We currently use BigData (http://bigdata.com/) as Triple Store.

You can use the following NGINX configuration:

	# Here, the /sparql/ URI is redirected
	# to Jetty. Furthermore, we only allow
	# GET without authentication, and authenticate
	# the other request types.
	location /sparql/ {
		limit_except GET {
			auth_basic "RestrictedStuff";
			auth_basic_user_file htpasswd;
		}
		proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/bigdata/sparql;
	}

Now, jetty shall only bind to localhost. Thus, start it as follows:

	JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djetty.host=127.0.0.1" bin/jetty.sh start
