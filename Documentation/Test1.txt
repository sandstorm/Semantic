I am on a flight from San Francisco to Chicago to attend the CMS Expo where Benni Mack, Seth Conley and I will be representing TYPO3. We will be presenting two introductions to TYPO3: an introduction section, and TYPO3 in the Enterprise. Additionally, TYPO3 has been invited to be part of three panels: CMS for Business; CMS in Government; and CMS in Education. It will be nice to give people an introduction to TYPO3, and we are also very much looking forward to hanging out the rest of the CMS community. There are several projects represented, including Drupal, Joomla, Umbraco, Dotnetnuke and SilverStripe, from what I have seen so far.

It has been a good couple of years for TYPO3 in the U.S. In just the past two years, TYPO3 has had significantly more U.S. visibility, and now we can add the CMS Expo to the list of U.S. conferences where TYPO3 has had a presence. We have been to OSCON twice, Gilbane Twice, and the third Opens external link in new windowUS conference is approaching in just over a month in San Francisco [http://t3con11-sf.typo3.org/]. Looking back three years, it is a great to see how far we have come. I think this may very well be the year that TYPO3 steps into its own.
