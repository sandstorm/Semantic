FLOW3 Semantic Framework
========================

The FLOW3 Semantic Framework helps FLOW3 developers to participate in the
Semantic Web, giving them tools to adhere to best-practices.

It has been developed by Sebastian Kurfuerst in his Diploma Thesis, and is
continued by him furthermore.

WARNING
-------

The current software is still in an unstable state; as it has been developed
for a FLOW3 Beta Version. It is currently being updated to the final version.

Functionality in a Nutshell
---------------------------

- Universal Mapping from Domain Models to RDF. We call this *Schema Mapping*
- Export Domain Model data as RDF (under a persistent URI) (not yet migrated to latest FLOW3)
- Send Domain Model data as RDF to a Triple Store (not yet migrated to latest FLOW3)
- transparently add RDFa to templates (not yet migrated to latest FLOW3)
- Enrich Domain Model data with Linked Data URIs, including longer texts (experimental)
- Export legacy databases to RDF, similar to Triplify
